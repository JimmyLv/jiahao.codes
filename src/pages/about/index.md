Hi! Iâ€™m Jia Hao. I write Software at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) in San Francisco, and previously [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/). Welcome to my site where I talk about the magical world of ones and zeroes.

This blog is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). SVG icons are taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) all over the world. Read more about the architecture of this blog [here](/blog/why-i-upgraded-my-website/).
